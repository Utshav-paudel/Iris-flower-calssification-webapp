* Classify the flower into setosa, virginica and versicolor  using following features :
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  -  Petal Length
  -   Petal Width
* ### Uses Decision Tree classifier as machine learning algorithm.
  * Decision Tree is a supervised Machine learning algorithm that uses a rule base approach to make decisions , it uses datasets features to create yes/no questions and continually split the dataset until you isolate all data point belonging to each class.
 
  * ## NOTE : It is also known as CART(Classification and Regression Tree) Algorithm
